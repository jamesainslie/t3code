/**
 * Fork-only. The Lathe rename as a pure text transform. Each `t3` occurrence
 * is classified by scripts/lib/forkRenameRules.ts; occurrences in a renamed
 * class (identifier, display, agent-facing, persisted) are rewritten through
 * one fixed table of brand units, and every other class is left exactly as it
 * is. The same transform runs over the fork and over upstream's tree for the
 * upstream-lathe mirror, so both sides of a sync agree on every renamed line.
 *
 * Deterministic and idempotent: renamed text holds no `t3` in a renamed
 * class, so a second pass changes nothing.
